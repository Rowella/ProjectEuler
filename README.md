# ProjectEuler
My code to solve the project Euler problems. Note that they are just the first attempt that gave the proper output and have not been optimised at all. If you want to spoil the problems for yourself place these functions in a base java file and (for most of them) just call them in System.out.println() with the the information required for the function.
